              | Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world population with some countries
              | and entities actively fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds

              |                         aiming to fix one problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is
              |                         to bring mass adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So
              |                         down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers and have them
              |                         download an app, buy into the social currency of their favourite person and watch their

              |                         We are trying to do to this space what
              |                         investment apps did for the &quot;nonexistent retail investors&quot;. We are gamefying digital currency,
              |                         bringing in popular faces instead of hard to understand projects to make it the norm and inadvertently being the &quot;gateway drug&quot; for a lot of people to finally give this space a real look.

              | A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as countries and creators
              | would be paid beyond the peanuts that conventional social media platforms can offer.

              |                             would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer would not find home there. Like Kanye
              |                             said, &quot;Personalities would become the new currency, and services would be built on top of them&quot;.

              |                             Currency is digital, it has been that way for a while now, but this time there would be no dead
              |                             presidents on the money, there would people like you on the money, and you would own it
              |                             because it would make the most sense in the world.
